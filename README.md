# spacesNG
Having designed Spaces.NG, as a design project while I was learning how to use AdobeXD and Figma, I thought I'd try my hands out on undertaking the front-end design for this project using only HTML/CSS/JS.<br>
The idea was to build a responsive website and I guess just have fun learning during my learning program in 2021. 
SpacesNG is a website App that let's you browse through a listing of short-lease offices and business spaces across Nigeria with a view of attracting Office-leasing Space businesses to host their business presence on SpacesNG which they can promote to attract an audience of prospecting clientele. Businesses can upload pictures of their available spaces such as offices, meeting rooms, business lounges and conference halls along with descriptions that best describes their available services as well as leasing terms and agreements. 
SpaceNG also lets business owners chat and engage with customers with its live Chat feature. 
Customers can book or make reservations for their desired Office spaces as well as make instant payment online using available payment channels.
Prospecting customers can open an account on SpacesNG to enjoy various discounts and promotions or choose to just browse available spaces/services without making any commitments.
I was learning Glass Morphism at the time of the design so you can see a lot of what I learnt had some influence on the output of my design and what you see in the implementation
